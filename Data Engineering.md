# Data Engineering
Using your database model as a blueprint, create a database schema for each of your tables and relationships. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any other constraints you defined. After creating the database schema, import the data from the corresponding CSV files.

# To receive all points, your code must:
1. Create a database schema for each table and relationship. (5 points)
2. Specify the data types. (5 points)
3. Define primary keys. (5 points)
4. Define foreign keys. (5 points)

# Process
- create a new database
- import the data (CSV files)
- specify the data types
Following the data model made in Data_Modeling.mpt the data types are as followes:
1. ID - int
2. name - varchar (60)
3. id_merchant_category_int
4. date - timestamp
5. amount - funds, cash 
6. card - varchar(20)
7. cardholder_id - int
- define the primary and foregin keys for the database
For reference a primary key surrounds the attribute that makes a table unique. A foreign key on the other hand helps to determine relationships between tables. A foreign key is a column(s) who relates to a column in another table. 
- produce the final database diagram
