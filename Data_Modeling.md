Data Modeling
Create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) by inspecting the provided CSV files. Part of the challenge here is to figure out how many tables you should create, as well as what kind of relationships you need to define among the tables. Feel free to discuss your database model design ideas with your classmates. You can use a tool like Quick Database Diagrams Links to an external site.to create your model.

Hints:
For the credit_card and transaction tables, the card column should be a VARCHAR (20) datatype rather than an INT.

For the transaction table, the date column should be a TIMESTAMP datatype rather than DATE.
